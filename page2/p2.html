            <p>Sarah has worked at Guardian Technologies for nearly a decade now. She started out her career at the company as an entry-level sales associate and has since worked her way up to a sales executive.</p>
            <p>She makes well over $100,000 a year, loves her team, her company and her life as a whole.</p>
            <p>When her more entrepreneurial friends poke fun at her for being a “nine-to-fiver” or “not dreaming big enough” she doesn’t mind. In fact, she finds it amusing.</p>
            <p>She deeply respects her friend’s drive to build the next Apple or Facebook… but she couldn’t be happier with her job and her life.</p>
            <p>She gets nights and weekends off as she watches her friends spend most of their “free time” working.</p>
            <p>During her late twenties, she has been able to cross countless destinations off her travel bucket list with a hefty 4-weeks worth of vacation each year, while her friends have been locked up in their apartments building and rebuilding and then rebuilding some more after that.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">Not to mention… when she hits her bonuses… she makes more than them combined. But, who is counting?</p>

            <h3>Let’s have a candid conversation about entrepreneurship vs. “employee-ship”.</h3>
            <p>I want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t a silly one… not in the least.</p>
            <p>After all, I chose that path for myself and that decision has allowed me to build JotForm to almost 4 million users over the last 12 years… and it has given me the chance to work with a team of incredible people…<b> a team of incredible employees.</b></p>
            <p>However, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an “employee” isn’t a silly one either. In fact, there is a great deal of me that would argue it’s a better one for some people.</p>
            <p class="highlight">“Help build an already established company (vs. lose sleep over thinking of all the entrepreneurial risks you took)?”</p>
            <p class="highlight">"Earn a hefty salary (vs. worry how on earth you’ll be able take care of your family for the rest of your life)?"</p>
            <p class="highlight">"Have the chance to one day move up the ranks (vs. embrace a completely uncertain future)?"</p>
            <p class="highlight">"Enjoy paid time off and other benefits (vs. burn yourself out in a culture that celebrates the 80-hour hustle)?"</p>
            <p><i>Where do I sign up?</i></p>
            <p><b>Unfortunately, in the twenty-first century, “employee-ship”</b> seemed to have gotten a bad rap, all of a sudden being a “9–5’er” became uncool… that aspiring to work for a company versus build one of your own somehow makes you small-minded, unmotivated or a follower. I totally disagree.</p>
            <p>The story about Sarah above (her name and the companies name have been changed for privacy purposes) highlights some of the benefits employees get to enjoy that most entrepreneurs don’t… until they “make it” (or if they ever make it).</p>
            <p>While I’m not naive to think that Sarah’s experience is every employee’s experience, hitting a home run and selling your company for a billion dollars isn’t every entrepreneur’s experience either — just a select few unicorns like Instagram.</p>
            <p>We need to talk more about the real cost of entrepreneurship and our worrying “Hustle until the haters ask if you’re hiring” mentality.</p>
